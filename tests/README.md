## Running Tests on Server

To run tests on the production server:

```bash
# SSH into server
ssh think@192.168.0.250

# Navigate to bot directory
cd ~/discord-maid-bot

# Load Node.js
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 20

# Run any test
node tests/test-homeassistant.js
node tests/test-esp-detection.js
```

## Requirements

All tests require:
- Node.js v20+
- `.env` file with `HA_URL` and `HA_TOKEN` configured
- Network access to Home Assistant instance

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail:
1. Check `.env` file has correct `HA_URL` and `HA_TOKEN`
2. Verify Home Assistant is accessible at the configured URL
3. Ensure the token has proper permissions
4. Check network connectivity

## Adding New Tests

When adding new test scripts:
1. Place them in this `tests/` folder
2. Use descriptive names starting with `test-`
3. Add documentation to this README
4. Include error handling and clear output
